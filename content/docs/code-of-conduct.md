It also applies to other spaces we exist such as our discord server and matrix server. Users visible on our sites regardless of whether they are local or federated may be actioned upon if they do not follow this code of conduct.

## Expected Behaviour
The following are expected behaviour for people interacting on our sites.

- **Remember the human:** When interacting with other people on the site they should be interacted with as if they are a human, that is with respect and in a way that you would want to be treated.
- **Keep in mind software differences:** As this is the fediverse, not everyone is interacting from the same software or the same type of software (people in microblogs may join in to the threaded posts, etc.). Due to this not everyone has access to the same features we do so features should not be assumed to be standard (e.g. visible pronouns, markdown, votes).

## Encouraged Behaviour
The following are encouraged behaviours for people interacting on our sites (that is not following it won't get you actioned upon but it is strongly recommended to follow).
- **Add Alt Text:** When posting an image add alt text to it in some form (if the software has it built in you can use that feature and if not you can provide it beside the image)

- **Impersonation:** Do not impersonate other people regardless of whether they are in the community or not.
- **Unmarked Sensitive Content:** Do not post sensitive content (such as NSFW) without labelling it as such. If the software does not allow you to label it for people who don't want that content to be able to not see it, do not post the content.
- **Hate Speech:** Do not make remarks directed at sex, gender, ethnicity, orientation, disabilities, etc.
