# Moderator Guidelines
These moderator guidelines detail expected conduct when moderating a community in one of the Programming.Dev ("programming.dev", "we", "us", "our") sites.

## Do we Make Updates to these Moderator Guidelines?
We may update the Moderator Guidelines from time to time. When we do the date at the bottom of the page will change to indicate the date of the most recent changes. In addition, clicking on that date will bring you to the commit in the code repository that shows who edited it, and what was changed. If we make changes we may notify you by posting a notice of such changes in our meta community on the programming.dev site, in the updates account on the bytes.programming.dev site, in the news community in our discord server, and in the news community in our matrix server. We encourage you to review the Moderator Guidelines periodically for any modifications.

## Contact Us
If you have questions or concerns about these Moderator Guidelines you should contact us at info@programming.dev.
